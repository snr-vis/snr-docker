## Credit

This Dockerfile uses code from [https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/tree/master/docker](https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/tree/master/docker):

* [https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/blob/master/docker/base/Dockerfile](https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/blob/master/docker/base/Dockerfile)
* [https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/blob/master/docker/rstudio/Dockerfile](https://github.com/opencpu/opencpu-server/blob/master/docker/rstudio/Dockerfile)

Simply because we need to start the OpenCPU server as last step to load overwritten packages. The `sudo apachectl restart` command seems to crash the docker container, therefore this hacky solution is required.

## TODO

Issues related to [SNR-GO](https://github.sf.mpg.de/pklemm/sonargo):

* [ ] Call `get_go_summary` for all important species of the current ensembl release on package compile
* [x] Increase opencpu response time to allow for `get_go_summary` to properly execute
* [ ] Fix common folder `/usr/local/var/ensembl` or make it the primary one - [https://github.sf.mpg.de/pklemm/sonargo/issues/2](https://github.sf.mpg.de/pklemm/sonargo/issues/2)
* [x] Fix `rlang` version hack by specifying proper dependencies in the snrgo and snr `R` package - [https://github.sf.mpg.de/pklemm/sonargo/issues/3](https://github.sf.mpg.de/pklemm/sonargo/issues/3)

## Build Container and Push to DockerHub

```bash
make
```

Developer build without pushing to DockerHub:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t snr . && docker tag snr paulklemm/snr:latest
```

## Run Container

Pull the container:

```bash
docker pull paulklemm/snr
```

OpenCPU is run as Docker container. In order to provide it with the required data, you have to pass it the following folders:

* `data` contains the differential gene expression data

Inside the `OpenCPU` docker image, a user called opencpu requires read and write access to the folders listed above. The opencpu user in docker image is user group `www-data`, therefore files mounted via `-v` have to be part of `www-data` group and should be group-writeable (e.g. 755).

**For instructions how to run the container, refer to [https://github.com/snr-vis/setup-snr](https://github.com/snr-vis/setup-snr).**

## Git Setup

Dev comment: this repo knows two origins:

```bash
# From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14290113/git-pushing-code-to-two-remotes
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:snr-vis/snr-docker.git
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.sf.mpg.de:pklemm/snr-docker.git
# Check with `git remote show origin`
```
